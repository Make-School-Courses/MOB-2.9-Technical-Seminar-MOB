# Interview Screencast

## Description

During your interview process, once you make it past the initial phone screener, the next phase is typically meeting with an engineer and doing a coding challenge over a browser-based live coding environment where both of you have access to the code. One example of these kinds of tools is [Coderpad](https://coderpad.io/), where you can both write and execute your code.

In addition to solving the problem provided to you, one of the most challenging parts of these interviews is being able to talk through your thought process, as that's generally what the interviewer is interested in more so than if you solved the problem silently. For this assignment, you will be given a problem to solve, and will record a screencast of you solving the problem, while talking through your thought process. The goal is to give you practice with this type of interviewing so that you're more prepared for it when you do it in an actual interview scenario.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you should be able toâ€¦

1. Solve the coding problem given to you
1. Showcase your interview communication skills by talking through your thought process
1. Demonstrate interview best practices such as testing your code, and optimizing it if needed

    
## Requirements

1. Provide a working solution to the problem given by using [Coderpad's sandbox](https://coderpad.io/sandbox) 
1. Record a screencast that shows you solving the problem from scratch, and also records audio so that we can hear you talk through it
1. You must talk about the following Interview Communication steps throughout your recording:
    1. Restate the problem
    1. State your assumptions
    1. Brainstorm solutions
    1. Explain your rationale
    1. Discuss tradeoffs
    1. Suggest improvements
1. You must run through a test of your solution as part of your recording, to prove that it works

### Stretch Requirements/Challenges (Optional)

1. Provide a list of clarifying questions you would ask if this were a real interview
1. Explain the runtime analysis of your solution
1. Provide an optimized solution that improves upon the one you originally wrote
1. Run through tests that involve good, bad, and edge case input

## Rubric

You must score at least 70 points to pass the assignment. Breakdown of points below:

1. **(25 points):** Provide a working solution to the problem given
1. **(5 points):** Record a screencast that shows you solving the problem from scratch, and also records audio so that we can hear you talk through it
