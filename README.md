# MOB 2.9 - Interview Prep and LLDB

## Course Description

This course is designed to be a seminar. Learning should be experimental, with the help of in-class activities, presentations and discussions. Students will practice interview questions in order to prepare for their technical interviews. Students will practice going through the three phases of interview topics: conceptual questions that you would receive on a phone screener, algorithmic questions that you would need to solve via a shared development environment while talking through your thought process, and completing take-home projects with realistic timeframes. Additionally, students will get more practice utilizing the Low Level Debugger (LLDB) to debug their applications, learning new techniques and commands to increase their debugging efficiency.

The class will culminate in a live mock interview with the instructor, putting everything you learned to test in a simulation of a real interview scenario.

## Prerequisites:

- [CS 1.3](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-1.3-Core-Data-Structures)

## Learning Objectives

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

1. Answer conceptual technical interview questions for an iOS developer role
1. Practice common algorithm interview questions using Swift
1. Implement take-home projects that you may see in an interview
1. Practice using advanced techniques for debugging using the LLDB
