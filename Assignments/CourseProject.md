# Course Project

## Description

 *NOTE: Because the course is the project, can this be the same?*

Students are onboarded to an existing project. If there's an unfamiliar framework or tool, technical workshops take place during the first sessions. Students are placed into teams and roles are assigned. Each team is responsible for an area of the project. By the end of the term, the class as a whole turns in a version of the project with approved and reviewed new features. All tracking is done using automated boards with GitHub projects.  


## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able toâ€¦

1. Implement new features in an existing code base
1. Manage git workflows via GitHub
1. Use automated boards with GitHub 
1. Practice how to deliver a status of a task during standups
