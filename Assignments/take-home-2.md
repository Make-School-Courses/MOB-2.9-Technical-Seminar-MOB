# Take Home Project No.2

## Introduction

When you get a take-home project for an interview, they usually are one of the following:

1. Full, detailed spec with designs to follow, and specific requirements that must be met (similiar to the first project you did)
1. A more open-ended project with only a handful of requirements, designed to see how you work when you're not given the full picture.

We're going to simulate the later with this project!

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, you should be able to...

1. Understand how to build a small project with little guidance
1. Practice basic app design skills by creating views without existing designs


## Description

You're going to be building an app that shows the 50 most popular artists on Spotify. There should be a separate view for each individual artist that shows their 10 most popular songs and number of followers.

Lastly, you should be able to "favorite" any of the available tracks, and can then access them in a list on a separate view in the app.


## Requirements

1. Adhere to the description
1. No 3rd party libarries
1. You must use the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

## Stretch challenges

1. Associate colors with popularity (i.e. Red is most popular, purple is least popular), and showcase them in some way for artists and/or tracks
1. Allow for the tracks to be previewed (30-sec clips)
1. Get creative with your designs!
